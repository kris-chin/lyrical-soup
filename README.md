# lyrical-soup
tool for aiding in the assitance of creating "lyrical soup" songs.

it takes in a CSV file where the first row is a header while every other row is a lyrical idea (eg. a concept, an actual lyric, a feeling, etc)
it then selects random lyrics from the file to generate a song of lyrical soup.

it reqires some configuation by manually editing Main.py, though I'll change it later.
